# Gemini Fast Research Prompt

## Research Objective

I want to conduct a deep technical security analysis of browser extensions focusing on architecture, vulnerabilities, and defense mechanisms.

The goal of this research is to understand modern browser extension security models (Manifest V2 vs Manifest V3), common exploitation techniques, real-world attack campaigns, and secure development best practices.

## Scope of Research

Please include the following topics in detail:

1. Browser extension architecture and execution environments  
2. Manifest V2 and Manifest V3 security differences  
3. Permission model risks and least privilege principle  
4. Content script vulnerabilities and DOM-based attacks  
5. Service worker security risks and race conditions  
6. Advanced attack techniques such as DOM clobbering, prototype pollution, CSS exfiltration, and extension fingerprinting  
7. Recent malware campaigns and supply chain attacks (2024–2025)  
8. Secure development best practices  
9. Enterprise defense and governance strategies  
10. Future security trends for browser extensions
